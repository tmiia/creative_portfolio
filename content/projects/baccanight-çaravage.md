title: Baccanight  Çaravage
description: The Çaravage game created for the Musée des Beaux-Arts aims to
  gamify the discovery of the museum during an event called “Bacchanight”.  In
  this project, I was mainly in charge of creating the different behaviors of
  the game's characters and updating their vitality points according to the
  attack used by each of them, all in JavaScript.
