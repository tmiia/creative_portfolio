description: Making a website about art from the angle of a color is what we
  were asked to do in this project. Adding a feature that would allow you to put
  filters coded from scratch in JavaScript on the site's photos was also part of
  the brief. For this project, I coded the web page in HTML SCSS JavaScript and
  created the filter to pixelize the images.
