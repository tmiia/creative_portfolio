description: >-
  Designing a game with Unity was the brief for this university project. There
  were two of us developers on this project, discovering object-oriented
  programming in C# on Unity.

  I was responsible for managing the interactions between the character and the collectable elements in the game. I was also responsible for managing the addition of items to the inventory and the conditions for adding vitality points.
